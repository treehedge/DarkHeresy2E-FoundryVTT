# Dark Heresy 2E - Continued

An (unoffially unofficial update to an) **UNOFFICIAL** system for playing Dark Heresy 2E on [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

It provides support for **character sheets only**, game content should be drawn from official source books.

The project is being continued under the GPL-3.0 License after the original author deleted their project.
^^ This fork is an experimental continuation to moo-man (et al.)'s continuation. It's mostly tweaked for private use and mostly consists of some specific features bolted on.
